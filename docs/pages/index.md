## What is Unleasharp.DB?

The Unleasharp.DB QueryBuilder library provides a fluent API for building and executing SQL queries with strong typing and expression-based syntax. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the Unleasharp.DB implementations for database operations. The library's fluent API and expression-based syntax make it easy to build complex queries while maintaining type safety and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Key Features

- **Fluent API Design**: Intuitive method chaining for query construction
- **Strong Typing**: Compile-time type safety with minimal runtime overhead
- **Expression-Based Syntax**: Leverages C# expressions for query building
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Automatic parameterization of user inputs
- **Multi-Database Support**: Compatible with major database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite)

### Quick Example

```csharp
var db  = new ConnectorManager("Data Source=unleasharp.db;Version=3;");
var row = db.QueryBuilder().Build(query => query
    .From<ExampleTable>()
    .OrderBy<ExampleTable>(row => row.Id, OrderDirection.DESC)
    .Limit(1)
    .Select()
).FirstOrDefault<ExampleTable>();
```

## What Unleasharp.DB Is Not

Unleasharp.DB QueryBuilder does not intend to replace most common ORMs used in the .NET ecosystem, like Entity Framework or Dapper. It doesn't aim to provide most of the features they offer:

### Features Not Included

- **Entity Tracking**: No change tracking or lazy loading capabilities
- **Migrations**: No database migration system
- **Entity Relationships**: No support for complex relationship mapping
- **Caching**: No built-in query result caching
- **Advanced ORM Features**: No LINQ to Entities, no proxy generation

### When to Use Unleasharp.DB

Use Unleasharp.DB when you need:

✅ **Simple Query Building** - For straightforward CRUD operations  
✅ **Performance-Critical Applications** - When you need maximum query performance  
✅ **Database Agnostic Queries** - For applications targeting multiple database platforms  
✅ **Expression-Based Querying** - When you prefer C# expression syntax over raw SQL  

### When to Consider Alternatives

Avoid Unleasharp.DB when you need:

❌ **Complex Entity Relationships** - For applications with intricate data models  
❌ **Advanced ORM Features** - When you require change tracking or lazy loading  
❌ **Database Migrations** - For applications requiring migration management  
❌ **Entity Framework Integration** - When working within existing EF ecosystems  

## Comparison With SQLKata
The following table illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of Unleasharp.DB against the widely-used SQLKata library.


| Feature                    | **Unleasharp.DB**                                                                                   | **SQLKata**                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query Builder**          | ✅ Fluent API for building SQL queries                                                              | ✅ Fluent API for building SQL queries                                                              |
| **Strong Typing**          | ✅ Expression-based (e.g. `movie => movie.ReleaseDate`), compile-time safety                        | ❌ String-based only, prone to typos and refactoring issues                                         |
| **String Flexibility**     | ✅ Can mix raw SQL strings when needed                                                              | ✅ Always string-based                                                                              |
| **Data Mapping**           | ✅ Built-in table-to-class mapping (`.ToList<User>()`, `.FirstOrDefault<Movie>()`)                  | ❌ Requires external mapper (Dapper, EF, etc.)                                                      |
| **Execution**              | ✅ Integrated execution layer via `ConnectorManager`                                                | ❌ Query builder only — execution handled separately                                                |
| **Multi-Database Support** | ✅ Separate packages for each database (`Unleasharp.DB.MySQL`, `.SQLite`, `.PostgreSQL`, `.MSSQL`)  | ✅ Multiple compilers (e.g. `SqlServerCompiler`, `PostgresCompiler`), configured at runtime         |

And the differences in different aspects of each library:

| Aspect                     | **Unleasharp.DB**                                                                                   | **SQLKata**                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dependencies**           | All-in-one: build + execute + map                                                                   | Must combine with a mapper/ORM (usually Dapper)                                                      |
| **Ecosystem & Community**  | Smaller, newer ecosystem                                                                            | Large community, widely adopted, battle-tested                                                       |
| **Learning Curve**         | Slightly steeper (mapping + connector setup) but safer long-term                                    | Very easy (just query building)                                                                      |
| **Use Case Fit**           | Best for teams wanting **type-safe queries, mapping, and execution in one lightweight library**     | Best for devs already using **Dapper/ORMs** who just need a flexible **query builder**               |


## Core Philosophy

Unleasharp.DB is designed to be a lightweight, focused library that excels at one thing: building safe, efficient SQL queries. It's not trying to be a full-featured ORM but rather a powerful query builder that can work alongside other tools in your stack.

> **Note**: While Unleasharp.DB provides excellent query building capabilities, it's recommended to combine it with appropriate data access patterns and consider the overall architecture of your application when choosing between different data access technologies [^1].

## Supported Databases

The library provides native support for the following database engines:

- **MySQL** (via MySqlConnector) - [Unleasharp.DB.MySQL](https://github.com/TraberSoftware/Unleasharp.DB.MySQL)
- **SQLite** (via System.Data.SQLite.Core) - [Unleasharp.DB.SQLite](https://github.com/TraberSoftware/Unleasharp.DB.SQLite)
- **PostgreSQL** (via Npgsql) - [Unleasharp.DB.PostgreSQL](https://github.com/TraberSoftware/Unleasharp.DB.PostgreSQL)
- **SQL Server** (via Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) - [Unleasharp.DB.MSSQL](https://github.com/TraberSoftware/Unleasharp.DB.MSSQL)
- **DuckDB** (via DuckDB.NET) - [Unleasharp.DB.DuckDB](https://github.com/TraberSoftware/Unleasharp.DB.DuckDB)

Each provider is optimized for its respective database engine while maintaining consistent API behavior across platforms.
